# Annual-Average-Rainfall-Prediction
Rainfall is a major source of fresh water in many parts of our country. From watering the crops to hydroelectricity rainfall judges the yield. We store water in reservoirs and make a wise use of it. But heavy rainfall cause damage. The main problem that we are not ready to face challenges of rainfall is that rainfall patterns are unknown. If we can predict the patterns of rainfall we can optimize the storage of water and take precautions of potential problems that may arise in the future. We can predict rainfall by modern computing techniques and data of rainfall in the past. Three main characteristics of rainfall are its amount, frequency and intensity, the values of which vary from place to place, day to day, month to month and also year to year. One of the methodologies that we can use to input data and predict values is Machine Learning. Rainfall can be predicted based on some parameters like Temperature, Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Dew Point. Humidity, Visibility, Wind. Changing Parameters result in the change in amount of annual average rainfall. The amount of rainfall is dependent on these parameters

                                                                Conclusion
The provided code implements a comprehensive solution for predicting annual rainfall based on meteorological data using a Random Forest Regressor. It involves preprocessing a dataset, training a machine learning model, and evaluating feature relationships through visualizations. The integration of Gradio allows for a user-friendly interface, enabling real-time predictions based on user inputs. Through the application of Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Scikit-learn for model training, and Matplotlib for visualization, the project effectively demonstrates a practical approach to regression modeling. The system not only provides accurate rainfall predictions but also ensures usability and accessibility through its interactive web interface, making it a robust tool for meteorological forecasting.
